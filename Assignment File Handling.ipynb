    "*) How a Process Pool Helps in Managing Processes Efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reduced Process Creation Overhead: Creating processes is costly in terms of system resources. A process pool minimizes    this overhead by maintaining a fixed number of reusable processes, rather than creating and destroying processes       \n",

    "\n",
    "2) Load Balancing: The pool helps distribute tasks evenly across processes, ensuring that no worker is overloaded while \n",
    "   others remain idle. This results in better load balancing and faster execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Efficient Resource Utilization: Since the number of processes in the pool is fixed, a process pool ensures that system    resources (like CPU and memory) are not exhausted by an excessive number of processes. This allows for more        \n",
    "   predictable and stable performance, especially in systems with limited resources."

    "*) Multiprocessing is a technique in Python that allows running multiple independent processes in parallel, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter instance. It is primarily used to overcome the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, enabling true parallel execution for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Bypasses the GIL: Allows processes to run in parallel without being blocked by the GIL, unlike multithreading.\n",
    "   Utilizes Multiple CPU Cores: Distributes tasks across multiple cores for faster execution, particularly for \n",
    "   computationally intensive tasks like scientific computing, data processing, and machine learning.\n",
